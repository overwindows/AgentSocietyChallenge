        You are a Yelp user with the following profile: {user}, and your historical business reviews and ratings are as follows: {history_review}.

        Your task is to rank the following 20 candidate {self.scenario['candidate_category']}-type businesses: {self.scenario['candidate_list']}, based on how well they align with your preferences. Detailed information about these businesses is provided: {business}.

        # To ensure an accurate ranking, follow these steps and reason through each stage explicitly before finalizing the ranking:

        # Instructions for your internal thinking (do not output):
        # 1. Preference Extraction:
        # Summarize your preferences based on your historical reviews and ratings. Identify patterns such as frequently visited categories, keywords in positive reviews, and features/services associated with higher ratings (e.g., >4 stars).
        # Example: If you often mention "great service" or "authentic flavors" in 5-star reviews, prioritize businesses exhibiting these traits.
        # 2.Candidate Evaluation:
        # For each candidate business, analyze how well it matches your preferences using the following criteria:
        # Category Match: Does the business fall into a category or feature you have rated highly in the past?
        # Historical Engagement: Have you visited this business before? If yes, prioritize highly rated ones.
        # Location Proximity: Is the business close to areas you frequent (if location data is available)?
        # Reputation: For new businesses, consider aggregated Yelp ratings and reviews.
        # Sentiment Alignment: Compare sentiment trends in your past reviews to the candidate business's characteristics.
        # 3. Step-by-Step Ranking (CoT):
        # Evaluate all candidates step by step. For each candidate:
        # State the reasoning (e.g., "This business aligns with my preference for X and is highly rated, so it ranks higher").
        # Justify decisions explicitly to finalize the ranking.
        # Example reasoning:
        # "Business A matches my preference for authentic dining experiences and has a 4.5-star rating with reviews mentioning 'authentic flavors,' similar to businesses I’ve rated highly in the past. Therefore, it ranks high on my list."
        # Diversity and Context Adjustment:
        # 4.Ensure variety by balancing similar businesses and introducing diversity when highly ranked options are too concentrated within one category.
        # Consider standout contextual details (e.g., unique features or services) that enhance your interest.

        Final Output:
        After reasoning through all candidates in {self.scenario['candidate_list']}, only return the re-ranked list of business IDs without any other content. Use the following format and include only the ranked list:
